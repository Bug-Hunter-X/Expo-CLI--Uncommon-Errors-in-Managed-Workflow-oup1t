This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and you encounter issues related to the managed workflow's limitations or unexpected behavior.  For instance, you might try to use a native module that's incompatible with the managed workflow or face limitations in accessing device features that require deeper integration with the native environment.  Expo's managed workflow simplifies development but has constraints that can lead to unexpected errors if you go beyond its capabilities.  These errors are often not explicitly defined but manifest as build failures, runtime crashes, or unexpected app behavior. A specific example could involve using a third-party library designed for React Native that directly interacts with native modules without an Expo-compatible wrapper.
