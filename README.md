# Expo CLI: Uncommon Errors in Managed Workflow

This repository demonstrates an example of uncommon errors encountered when using Expo's managed workflow.  These errors typically stem from limitations of the managed workflow or incompatibilities with native modules.

The `uncommonExpoError.js` file shows an example scenario that leads to an error.  The `uncommonExpoSolution.js` file offers a solution (possibly involving switching to the bare workflow, using an Expo-compatible alternative, or modifying the approach).
