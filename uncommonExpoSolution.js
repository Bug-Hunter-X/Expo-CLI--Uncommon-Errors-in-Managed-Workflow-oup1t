The solution depends on the specific error encountered.  Common approaches include:

1. **Switching to the Bare Workflow:** If the error is fundamentally caused by the limitations of the managed workflow, moving to the bare workflow provides more control over the native modules and allows for direct integration, solving compatibility issues.  This approach requires more hands-on native code handling. 
2. **Using Expo-Compatible Alternatives:**  Search for alternatives to problematic third-party libraries or native modules. Expo maintains compatibility with many common libraries, so finding an alternative may resolve the issue without leaving the managed workflow.  
3. **Modifying the Approach:** If the problem is not a direct incompatibility but rather a limitation in how you are using a particular feature, review the documentation for Expo and React Native to see if there are alternative methods to achieve the same result within the constraints of the managed workflow. 
4. **Debugging with Expo's Tools:** Use the Expo CLI's debugging tools, such as logging statements and remote debugging, to get a better understanding of what is failing and pinpoint the cause of the problem.
